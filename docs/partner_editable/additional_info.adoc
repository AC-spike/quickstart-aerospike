// Add steps as necessary for accessing the software, post-configuration, and testing. Donâ€™t include full usage instructions for your software, but add links to your product documentation for that information.
//Should any sections not be applicable, remove them

== Test the deployment
// If steps are required to test the deployment, add them here. If not, remove the heading
After the AWS CloudFormation stack is complete, you can test the deployment by checking whether the instances were properly enrolled with your {partner-product-short-name} project.

To validate the system and verify the system configuration, follow these steps: 
1. From bastion host, use SSH to log in to one of the aerospike instance created by Quick Start template. It's recommended to use ssh key forwarding for security purpose. More info on ssh key forwarding can be found https://docs.github.com/en/developers/overview/using-ssh-agent-forwarding[here]
----
$ ssh ec2-user@<aerospike-instance>
----

2. Verify cluster information using `asadm` command. More information about asadm can be found https://docs.aerospike.com/docs/tools/asadm/[here]. For two node cluster output should look like this : 
----
$ asadm
Seed:        [('127.0.0.1', 3000, None)]
Config_file: /home/ec2-user/.aerospike/astools.conf, /etc/aerospike/astools.conf
Aerospike Interactive Shell, version 2.0.1

Found 2 nodes

3. Insert record using https://docs.aerospike.com/docs/tools/aql/[aql]. Following commands inserts a record in test namespace with foo as set name and bar as bin name:
----
$ aql

User:         None
Config File:  /etc/aerospike/astools.conf /home/ec2-user/.aerospike/astools.conf

aql> insert into test.foo (PK, bar) values (123, 'you did it!')
OK, 1 record affected.

aql> select * from test.bar
0 rows in set (0.023 secs)

OK

aql> select * from test.foo
+---------------+
| bar           |
+---------------+
| "you did it!" |

1 row in set (0.036 secs)

OK
