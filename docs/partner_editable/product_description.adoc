Aerospike is a real-time NoSQL database that provides a key-value store with a flexible data model that enables you to manage real-time data at petabyte scale with microsecond latency.  It supports a Hybrid Memory Architecture™ where indexes, including the primary index and optional secondary indexes, are stored by default in DRAM for ultra-fast access. The primary index can also be configured to be stored in an NVMe flash device. Data can be stored either in DRAM or more cost-effectively on SSDs. With Aerospike you can configure each namespace separately, so small namespaces can take advantage of DRAM and larger ones gain the cost benefits of SSDs.  

Aerospike is frequently used for data-intensive, geo-distributed applications delivering the performance of a cache with the persistence of a NoSQL database. It provides a rich set of enterprise features which include Multi-site clustering, Cross Datacenter Replication™ (XDR), Fast Restarts, Rapid Rebalance, and TLS Security.

AWS enables you to set up the cloud infrastructure to support Aerospike deployments in a scalable and cost-effective way on AWS EC2.  This reference deployment will help you build an Aerospike cluster by automating deployment tasks to quickly install an Aerospike instance with a limited single node-license, or bring your own license to quickly stand up an Aerospike clusters using the Aerospike Cloud Formation Template (CFT) across multiple availability zones.
