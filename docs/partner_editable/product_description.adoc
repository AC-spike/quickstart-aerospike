{partner-product-short-name} is a real-time data platform that delivers predictable performance at petabyte scale with microsecond latency across billions of transactions. 

//TODO What does "performance" refer to ... what are we saying the platform predictably does?

Aerospike is frequently used for data-intensive, geodistributed applications delivering the performance of a cache with the persistence of a NoSQL data platform. It provides multisite clustering, cross-datacenter replication, fast restarts, rapid rebalancing, and security-related features. 

Aerospike features a hybrid memory architecture where indexes, including the primary index and optional secondary indexes, are stored by default in DRAM for fast access. You can also store data on solid-state drive (SSDs) by configuring each namespace separately. Small namespaces can take advantage of DRAM, and larger ones gain the cost benefits of SSDs.  

Quick Starts are automated reference deployments that use AWS CloudFormation templates to launch, configure, and run the AWS compute, network, storage, and other services required to deploy a specific workload on AWS. This Quick Start helps you build an {partner-product-short-name} cluster by automating deployment tasks to quickly install an {partner-product-short-name} instance with a limited single-node license. Alternatively, bring your own license to quickly stand up {partner-product-short-name} clusters using the {partner-product-short-name} CloudFormation template across multiple Availability Zones.
