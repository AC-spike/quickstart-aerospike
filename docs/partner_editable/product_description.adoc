{partner-product-short-name} is a real-time data platform that delivers predictable performance at petabyte scale with microsecond latency across billions of transactions. Aerospike is frequently used for data-intensive, geo-distributed applications delivering the performance of a cache with the persistence of a NoSQL data platform. It provides a rich set of enterprise features which include Multi-site clustering, Cross Datacenter Replication™ (XDR), Fast Restarts, Rapid Rebalance, and TLS Security.  Aerospike features a Hybrid Memory Architecture™ where indexes, including the primary index and optional secondary indexes, are stored by default in DRAM for ultra-fast access. Data can be stored either in DRAM or more cost-effectively on SSDs by configuring each namespace separately, so small namespaces can take advantage of DRAM and larger ones gain the cost benefits of SSDs.  

Quick Starts are automated reference deployments that use AWS CloudFormation templates to launch, configure and run the AWS compute, network, storage, and other services required to deploy a specific workload on AWS. This reference deployment will help you build an {partner-product-short-name} cluster by automating deployment tasks to quickly install an {partner-product-short-name} instance with a limited single node-license, or bring your own license to quickly stand up an {partner-product-short-name} clusters using the {partner-product-short-name} Cloud Formation Template (CFT) across multiple availability zones.
